    <description>No more useless key pieces in Greed Mode! The Mega Satan door will now spawn after defeating Ultra Greed.

After defeating Mega Satan, a big chest, fresh donation machine, and golden penny will spawn. A door will also open allowing you to exit the room.

To get key pieces from Devil Rooms, you can use either of these mods:

[/list]

Mod Config Menu will give you the option to fight Mega Satan instead of Ultra Greed or Mega Satan after Ultra Greed.

If you have Repentogon then you'll get Mega Satan completion marks, and built-in characters will earn their achievements. Modded characters may require some additional work.

Note: Don't skip Ultra Greed if you're trying to get your Greed Mode unlocks.</description>
